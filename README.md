# HomeAutomationSimulation
This project is a comprehensive home automation simulation specifically designed for kitchen and living room environments. 
It integrates the following technologies:

- **Wokwi**: for virtual prototyping, providing a realistic simulation environment.
- **Blynk**: for real-time control interfaces, ensuring seamless interaction with smart devices.
- **ThingSpeak**: for data logging and analytics, enabling comprehensive environmental monitoring and insights.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: for enhanced safety, which detects children near the gas stove and raises timely alarms. YOLOv8 was utilised for object detection. A diverse dataset was used to train the model, thus making it more efficient and usable for various environments.
## Features
